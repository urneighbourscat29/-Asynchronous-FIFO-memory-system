FIFO serves as a crucial design component for enabling seamless data transfer between two modules, 
regardless of whether they operate at the same clock frequency or across different frequencies. 
In my implementation, I have designed and developed both Synchronous FIFO and Asynchronous FIFO architectures using Verilog, 
ensuring efficient and reliable communication between components. The RTL design was thoroughly verified using Verilog-based testbenches to validate 
functionality and performance under various scenarios. Special attention was given to handling clock domain crossings in the Asynchronous FIFO design, 
incorporating proper synchronization techniques to prevent race conditions, metastability, and glitches, thereby guaranteeing robust and error-free operation 
in environments involving multiple clock domains. This approach ensures data integrity and stability, making the design suitable for high-performance and low-latency applications.
